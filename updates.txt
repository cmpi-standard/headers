1. Started syncing function descriptions with spec. TODO_AM indicates
   where this work needs to be resumed (top to bottom in cmpift.h).
2. Discovered several new spec issues (see specissues.md for a list of them
   and which ones are already addressed in the header files). This includes
   adding the filtered up-calls to the CMPIBrokerFT table, which we had
   forgotten so far.
3. Cleaned up descriptions of common function arguments, such as mb, mi, ctx,
   rc.
4. Cleaned up descriptions of return values that are CMPIStatus.
5. Changed a few remaining @retval to @return. @retval does not support
   @parblock.
6. Moved deprecation notes for deprecated return codes from the return code
   list to a function-level @deprecated statement, so it shows up in the
   deprecation list (@deprecated starts a top level section, so having it
   as part of the return code list does not work anyway).
7. Made all references to capabilities in the same way, so that the respective
   MB capabilities bit is linked.
8. Changed return code list into return code table for
   CMPIPropertyMIFT.getProperty(), to be consistent with the other MI functions.
9. Added @p to more arguments and structure members.
10. Replaced remaining textual statements about required functionality with the
   @required210 command.
11. Made sure that references to CMPI spec subclauses have either been replaced
   by linking to the corresponding linkable entity, or are explicitly called
   out to be to "Subclause x.x.x. of the CMPI Standard", where "CMPI Standard"
   links to the respective spot on the main page. There are some remaining
   ones that will be handled during description sync, they are marked with
   (TBD).

1. Clean up some minor issues in @returns and standardize the text so says
same thing in every case.
2. Clean up rc so same text everywhere.
3. Clean up a number of minor issues
4. Started @see between cmpimacs and cmpift.h working down cmpimacs. about
25% finished and will finish tomorrow. These go both ways cmpift<->cmpimacs
