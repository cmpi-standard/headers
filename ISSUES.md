KNOWN/Possible Issues
=====================

This is a list of issues/problems/etc with the documentation.  It is intended
to just list those things that are not specific and could be listed by
@todo in the headers.

* This stuff cries out for examples.

  AM: Where?
  KS: Discuss next telecon.

* See C Data Types for CIM Data Types (Subclause 5.4).  Why the more...
  What does it mean?

  AM: It means there is description in addition to the brief description.
  KS: Will recheck but in some cases there was nothing.  That was the confusion.

* modules.h shows up in file list of HTML output (Files tab).
