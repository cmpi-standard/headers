LIST OF TODOs for CMPI header file Documentation
================================================

* KS- 29 July 2015-The header files probably need a version mechanism so that the documentation
  clearly reflects what is available from the source (be it uploaded or in a
  version control system).

* TODO Karl: Test against a build. In process

* TBD Both: Review order of sections for functions described in guidelines.md.

  Discuss next telecon.

* TBD Both: Review outline of Related Pages, outline of Modules tabs, and main
  page content.

  Discuss next telecon.  Karl MUST review offline and agree with this.

* NOTE: The close date for this work is actually shortly before the final
  release of the spec at end of July. Actually the date is out in agusust now while
  open group reviews the changes proposal after we approve  it.

* TODO Both: figure out how we can get this mess of files into a web without
  uploading the many hundreds of files. Or into the wiki with the same issue.
  The manual upload tools these sites offer are not really logical for this
  large set of files that may change from time to time.

  Andy: I looked at readthedocs.org, and while not officially supported yet, it
  seems to be possible to use Doxygen there. They clone the repo and build the
  docs for themselves, as an automated process.
  The repo has to be public.

  KS: For some reason, (I have not received an answer that makes sense) OpenGroup
  was opposed to putting the headers on github so my guess is that they have
  issues with this also. His comment was:

* NOTE: Response from M.Kirk about using github:

    We have just conducted a small experiment with using Github for development in
    another Forum, and the problem is that it puts it outside of our SSO
    environment, and that makes it difficult for meeting our rules on access
    to all Open Group members.

    I would therefore counsel against this.

    regards,

    Martin

  Therefore I am going elsewhere in OpenGroup to see if we can get better answer.

Suggestion create the project in github and readthedocs and let opengroup actively
disagree.
