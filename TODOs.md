LIST OF TODOs for CMPI header file Documentation
================================================

* Karl: Test against a build.

* Finish returns, specifically for those returns that return CMPIStatus.
  See @todo for proposals
  Status: Done(Andy).

* Karl: Clean up cmpimacs.
  Status: Most links from macs back in place but not all working.  Many of the
  functions do not have macros.  Also lots of @todo add macros in cmpift.h
  as I worked my way through and I have to weed those out.

* Andy: Sync function descriptions in cmpift.h with spec.
  Status: In progress, this is being done in order of the functions in the file;
  TODO_AM indicates where this stands.

* make decision about the poor doc in macro files. Remove much of it, make same
as cmpift or leave it.

NOTE: The close date for this work is actually shortly before the final release
of the spec at end of July.

* Both: figure out how we can get this mess of files into a web without uploading the
many hundreds of files. Or into the wiki with the same issue. The manual upload
tools these sites offer are not really logical for this large set of files that
may change from time to timem
