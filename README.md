CMPI header files
=================

This project maintains the C/C++ header files of the OpenGroup CMPI Standard.

CMPI stands for "Common Manageability Programming Interface" and is a C-language
API between a Management Broker (aka CIMOM) and Management Instrumentation (aka
Providers). CMPI supports the CIM and WBEM standards defined by
[DMTF](http://www.dmtf.org).

The CMPI Standard (that is, the document) is maintained on the
[CMPI Working Group web space](https://wiki.opengroup.org/councils-wiki/doku.php?id=forums:enterprise_management:cmpi:start).

At this point, version 2.1 of the CMPI Standard is being finalized, and the
CMPI header files are nearly done as well.

The header files are enabled for generating documentation using Doxygen. The
goal is to generate the documentation automatically and to publish it on
readthedocs.org(https://readthedocs.org/). This has not been established yet but
is supposed to happen soon.
