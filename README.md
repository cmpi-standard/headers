CMPI header files
=================

The [cmpi-headers project on GitHub](https://github.com/cmpi-wg/cmpi-headers)
maintains the C/C++ header files of the OpenGroup CMPI Standard.

CMPI stands for "Common Manageability Programming Interface" and is a C-language
API between a Management Broker (aka CIMOM) and Management Instrumentation (aka
Providers). CMPI supports the CIM and WBEM standards defined by
[DMTF](http://www.dmtf.org).

The CMPI Standard (that is, the document) is maintained on the
[CMPI Working Group web space](https://wiki.opengroup.org/councils-wiki/doku.php?id=forums:enterprise_management:cmpi:start).

Status
------

At this point, version 2.1 of the CMPI Standard is being finalized, and the
CMPI header files are nearly done as well.

The header files are enabled for generating documentation using Doxygen. The
goal is to generate the documentation automatically and to publish it on
[readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/). This has not been established yet
but is supposed to happen soon.

Feedback and contributions
--------------------------

Feedback on the CMPI header files is welcome. Please provide any feedback via
the issue tracker of the
[cmpi-headers project on GitHub](https://github.com/cmpi-wg/cmpi-headers).

Contributions to the CMPI header files are welcome as well, specifically
contributions to the examples in the function descriptions of the header files.
For now, it is suggested that contributions be made also via the issue tracker.

The Open Group rules on feedback and contributions apply, as documented in the
CMPI Standard.

Note that feedback on the CMPI Standard itself should be made as directed in
the CMPI Standard.
