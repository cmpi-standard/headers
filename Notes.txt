Notes on using Doxygen for to document CMPI headers

1. References to parameters within a function definition should be
surrounded by <tt> ... </tt>. Dozygen has no specific tag for these things

2. References to External functions TBD

3. Pointers to other functions within this environment This should be ref I
   think. Need to test.
   
4. References to external files TBD

5. Defining error codes.  Right now we just define the code and text in
   the forme <li>CODE NAME   text. We do not include the error CIM_ERROR. That
   will probably mean changing to a table to format


KNOWN Issues:

1. Shows prototype as :

  CMPIStatus(* _CMPIIndicationMIFT::activateFilter)(CMPIIndicationMI *mi, const CMPIContext *ctx, const CMPISelectExp *filter, const char *className, const CMPIObjectPath *classPath, CMPIBoolean firstActivation)

  Note that :: scoping definition.

2. Still needs more work for consistency, spelling, dumb errors, etc.

3. The macro page is a mess in Doxygen

4. Needs lead page before going on line but that is not issue for the
   headers themselves.

5. Need reference back to doc.

6. Testing just started.

7. The Modules list is really incomprenensible.  Somehow we need to organize
   and describe the modules doc definitions better.  Also, apparently doxygen
   does this all as one line entries so that one of them just shows up as

   "Definition of symbols for"

   since that is all that is on the first line.

8. The function APIs are document as Variables, not functions.  I assume that
   this is because of the indirect definition. Looks like Doxygen cannot
   handle this.

9. This stuff cries out for examples.

10. There is a more... hyperlink in a number of places but nothing behind it apparently
